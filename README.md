### About iron-branch

- A non-visual app as much as possible is the primary goal. After that, it will be possible to enhance the visual effect by selecting according to the user's choice. For example, player earnings ranking charts, tower and barracks status, etc.
- The name `iron-branch` is inspired by the [Iron Branch](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Iron_Branch) item in dota 2 for sure. and no meaning for that ðŸ˜‚
